        "question": "Design an operating doctrine for a teacher–AI copilot in K–12 that maximizes learning outcomes while protecting teacher agency, student privacy, and equity.",
        "think": "A workable doctrine must reconcile three tensions: personalization vs standards, automation vs human judgment, and data utility vs privacy. Start by clarifying the locus of authority: the AI proposes, the teacher decides. That implies a decision-rights matrix where the copilot can suggest pacing, resources, and micro-assessments, but cannot unilaterally grade high-stakes work, diagnose learning disorders, or trigger discipline. Next, define measurable outcomes that balance achievement (mastery growth, retention), well-being (stress proxies, help-seeking), and equity (gap-narrowing across demographics). Without explicit metrics, optimization drifts toward convenience. On privacy, lean on data minimization and purpose limitation: collect only what improves instruction, maintain short retention windows for raw interaction logs, and push toward on-device inference when feasible. Differential privacy or secure aggregation can protect class-level analytics; sensitive signals (biometrics) require explicit opt-in with accessible alternatives. To prevent bias amplification, the doctrine needs fairness evaluation at three layers: content (representation), recommendation (who gets which challenge), and outcomes (performance by subgroup). Teachers need visibility and override tools, so the UI must foreground why-suggestions with compact rationales and confidence, plus counterfactual options (e.g., “if you pick the alternative, expect 8–10% lower cognitive load”). For pedagogy integrity, encode a conservative fail-safe: when model uncertainty spikes or data is sparse, revert to curriculum-aligned defaults rather than speculative adaptation. Implementation should follow a capability maturity curve: begin with assistive analytics and formative feedback before expanding into adaptive sequencing; require validation pilots with A/B designs and preregistered metrics. Procurement clauses must mandate exportable logs, interoperable data schemas, and vendor-neutral evaluation APIs to avoid lock-in. Professional development is part of the system: teachers need just-in-time microlearning embedded in the copilot, plus simulated practice to build trust. Equity requires resourcing: offline-capable modes, multilingual support, and accessibility-first design; budget lines must fund devices/connectivity where needed. Finally, governance: a school-level oversight committee reviews monthly fairness and safety dashboards; a district board audits quarterly; and an annual public report discloses performance, incidents, and model updates. This yields an actionable, accountable doctrine rather than principles on paper.",
        "output": "Operating Doctrine: Teacher–AI Copilot for K–12\n\n1) Purpose and Scope\nThe copilot augments teacher capacity for planning, formative assessment, and differentiated instruction. It does not replace professional judgment, conduct high-stakes grading, determine placement, or recommend discipline.\n\n2) Decision Rights and Boundaries\n• Copilot MAY: propose lesson pacing, generate practice items aligned to standards, surface misconceptions, recommend small-group formations, draft feedback, and summarize class trends.\n• Copilot MUST NOT: finalize high-stakes grades, issue behavioral labels, make special-education determinations, or collect biometric signals without explicit opt-in and non-biometric alternatives.\n• Teacher retains final say; every suggestion is explainable with a concise rationale and confidence band.\n\n3) Safety, Privacy, and Data Governance\n• Data minimization: collect only instructionally necessary signals; default retention ≤90 days for raw logs.\n• On-device or school-edge inference where feasible; encrypted transit/storage; role-based access.\n• Privacy by design: purpose limitation, consent management for sensitive data, student/parent data access portals.\n• Fairness guardrails: pre-release bias testing, continuous subgroup monitoring, corrective reweighting where gaps widen.\n\n4) Pedagogical Quality and Equity\n• Standards alignment: every recommendation maps to explicit objectives and rubrics.\n• Conservative fallback: when uncertainty is high, revert to grade-level canonical pathways.\n• Accessibility: multilingual UX, screen-reader compliance, offline-first modes; resource budgets to close device/connectivity gaps.\n\n5) Evaluation and Transparency\n• Preregistered metrics across achievement, well-being, and equity; report quarterly to staff and annually to the public.\n• Teacher-facing dashboards show why-suggestions and alternatives; one-click feedback loops inform model updates.\n• Incident response: triage within 48 hours, remediation within 14 days, public postmortems for material issues.\n\n6) Interoperability and Procurement\n• Open schemas (IMS/Caliper/xAPI), exportable event logs, evaluation API for third-party audits, clear exit clauses.\n• No dark patterns: opt-outs honored without penalty; settings portable across classrooms.\n\n7) Implementation Roadmap\n• Phase 1 (Assist): insights + formative feedback; professional learning embedded.\n• Phase 2 (Adapt): limited sequencing with teacher gating; intensified fairness checks.\n• Phase 3 (Optimize): multi-class orchestration with safeguards, periodic external audits.\n\nThis doctrine operationalizes human-in-the-loop learning, measurable equity, and privacy by default—so the copilot amplifies great teaching rather than automating it.",

        "think": "Begin by separating slow, structural forces (demographics, public finance constraints, compute efficiency curves, climate disruptions) from volatile uncertainties (regulatory harmonization, public trust in AI, vendor consolidation, breakthrough modalities like multimodal AR). Use two orthogonal critical uncertainties to frame scenarios: (A) governance model—open, interoperable ecosystems vs walled garden platforms; and (B) societal trust—high-trust adoption with strong safeguards vs low-trust backlash and constraint. This yields four futures: Open/High-Trust (Civic Commons), Open/Low-Trust (Patchwork Skepticism), Walled/High-Trust (Guided Utility), Walled/Low-Trust (Fractured Lock-in). For each, identify strategic opportunities, risks, and policy choices. Civic Commons promises plural innovation and equity but demands sustained public investment and coordination capacity. Patchwork Skepticism risks inequities and duplication; resilience depends on local ingenuity and low-cost offline tech. Guided Utility can scale improvements quickly but creates dependency and bargaining risk; safeguards must be hardwired. Fractured Lock-in combines low trust with concentration—expect underinvestment, litigation, and stalled outcomes; policy must prioritize exit options and minimum service guarantees. Next, define signposts (observable indicators) and triggers (action thresholds). Examples: proportion of spend under open standards, number of vendors controlling >50% of classrooms, baseline public trust scores, frequency of AI incidents per 10k learners, prevalence of offline-capable deployments, and share of teacher time reclaimed. Build a rolling horizon dashboard: quarterly updates for fast-moving indicators (incidents, outages), annual for structural ones (achievement gaps), and biennial deep-dives (equity and workforce effects). Couple the dashboard to no-regrets moves that pay off across futures: teacher AI literacy, interoperability mandates, offline/edge capabilities, fairness audit pipelines, and diversified procurement with exit clauses. Add option bets tailored to specific futures (e.g., public compute for the Commons, regulatory sandboxes for Guided Utility). Establish kill criteria for programs that fail to meet equity or safety thresholds after defined windows. Governance: a small cross-ministry cell runs the system, with public reporting, stakeholder panels, and an independent methods audit to avoid politicization.

Risk: coordination fatigue.\n  2) Patchwork Skepticism (Open, Low-Trust): local experimentation, uneven quality, frequent moratoria. Policy lever: minimum safety baselines and rapid-response evaluation teams. Risk: widening inequity.\n  3) Guided Utility (Walled, High-Trust): turnkey platforms, quick gains. Policy lever: contractually embed interoperability, price controls, and exit/escrow.

Policy lever: emergency ‘basic AI services’ guarantees, antitrust action, public alternatives.\n\nSignposts and Triggers\n• Market concentration (HHI index, top-2 vendor share), open-standard adoption rates, incident density per 10k learners, offline-capable coverage %, teacher time reallocation, public trust index, fairness gap trends. \n• Triggers tie to policy playbooks: e.g., if HHI > 0.25 and incident density rises two quarters, activate diversification procurement and mandate audit API access.\n\nNo-Regrets Portfolio\n• Teacher AI literacy and coaching; interoperability mandates; offline/edge delivery; continuous fairness and safety evaluations; procurement with exit clauses and escrowed model checkpoints; student privacy tooling (consent dashboards, minimization by default).\n\nOption Bets\n• Civic Commons: public compute credits, open reference curricula, federated learning hubs.\n• Guided Utility: regulatory sandboxes, outcome-based contracts with clawbacks.\n• Patchwork: micro-grants for rural/offline deployments and shared open toolkits.\n• Fractured: antitrust cases, national fallback platforms, crisis connectivity funds.\n\nGovernance and Cadence\n• A cross-ministry Strategy Cell publishes a quarterly indicator report, an annual public review, and biennial deep-dive on equity and workforce. Independent methods auditors verify metrics. Stakeholder panels (teachers, parents, students) can recommend playbook activation when triggers hit.\n\nExit and Kill Criteria\n• Programs sunset if they fail pre-registered equity and safety thresholds over 6–8 quarters.\n\nThis system keeps strategy adaptive, protects against lock-in, and focuses investment on moves that win across futures while preserving the option to pivot when the world surprises us.",

Next, define global non-negotiables: data privacy baselines, transparency in algorithms, and fairness audits. Instead of a centralized enforcement model, adopt a federated structure: UNESCO sets principles, regional hubs contextualize them, and national authorities implement. To prevent fragmentation, establish interoperability protocols (data schemas, audit APIs). A multistakeholder Global AI in Education Council could issue annual reports and certify compliance tiers. Dispute resolution requires arbitration mechanisms, similar to WTO processes, where national grievances can be mediated. To prevent regulatory capture, rotating membership and conflict-of-interest disclosures are critical. Funding should come from assessed contributions plus vendor levies to avoid donor bias. Evaluation requires periodic peer reviews—cross-country teams auditing each other’s deployments. Sovereignty is respected through opt-in protocols: states align voluntarily but gain access to shared infrastructure, training, and certification benefits.
