        "question": "Architect an AI-driven “global rebrand factory” that can generate, localize, and quality-assure brand assets for 25 markets in parallel without sacrificing accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA), cultural nuance, or IP safety. What system design, governance, datasets, and evaluation loops would you implement so that (a) designers retain creative control, (b) localization teams can inject cultural knowledge, and (c) legal/compliance can block risky outputs in real time?",
        "think": "Start by clarifying the objectives and hard constraints: scale (25 markets), accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA), cultural nuance, and IP safety. Success requires a modular pipeline with human-in-the-loop gates rather than a monolithic generator. Decompose into services: (1) brief ingestion, (2) concept exploration, (3) asset generation, (4) localization & accessibility adaptation, (5) compliance & IP scanning, (6) evaluation & sign-off, and (7) telemetry/learning loop. Each service must expose controls so designers can steer direction and localization teams can override defaults.\nFor models, use a multi-model approach: a text model for creative briefs and copy variants, an image model for visual ideation, and a layout engine for templating. Add controllability: style tokens, ControlNet/conditioning, and design-system constraints (brand color tokens, typographic scales, spacing rules). To preserve brand identity, embed a machine-readable brand system (JSON: palette with acceptable contrast pairs, type ramp with minimum sizes, logo placement constraints). Implement a constraint solver that rejects generations violating brand or WCAG thresholds.\nFor data, curate three corpora: (A) first-party brand assets with lineage metadata and approvals, (B) market-local reference libraries vetted by cultural experts (e.g., motifs, symbolism, taboo lists), and (C) a rights-cleared training reference set with explicit licenses. Tag all entries with structured metadata: culture, register, emotional tone, age-appropriateness, and risk notes. Maintain an immutable provenance ledger per output: prompt, seeds, models, asset sources, reviewers, approvals.\nGovernance: define RACI. Designers own creative direction; localization leads own cultural sign-off; legal owns IP and claims; accessibility specialists own WCAG review. Establish red-team playbooks (bias, stereotyping, political missteps) and escalation paths. Build a real-time policy engine where legal/compliance can toggle blocklists (for imagery, symbols, phrases) per market.\nEvaluation: create automated checks before human review: (1) brand compliance score via perceptual similarity to reference styleboards; (2) WCAG color contrast checks, text legibility metrics, motion/flash thresholds; (3) cultural risk heuristics (symbol classifiers + market taboo lexicons); (4) IP safety via perceptual hashing and similarity search against known protected marks/style sets; (5) hallucination/claim detector for copy. Only assets passing thresholds move to human gates.\nHuman-in-the-loop: designers receive a controllable panel (sliders: novelty vs fidelity, cultural warmth, formality). Localization teams can swap motifs from their vetted libraries. Legal sees side-by-side similarity diffs, license provenance, and can hard-block variants. Close the loop with telemetry: track reasons for rejections, user edits, and post-campaign performance; feed back into prompt templates, risk thresholds, and market-specific guardrails.",

        "think": "Frame the problem as balancing exploitation (high-performing styles) with exploration (new looks) under brand and accessibility constraints. Need measurable style representation and an online learning strategy. Represent style as embeddings: compute a ‘style fingerprint’ for each asset using a multimodal model (e.g., CLIP-like) combining color histograms, composition descriptors, typography encodings, and motif tags. Maintain a style bank (centroids) by channel/market. Define diversity metrics at batch and portfolio levels: coverage (how much of style space we occupy), dispersion (variance), and novelty (distance from historical clusters). Also define similarity caps within campaigns to avoid duplicates.\nFor KPIs, track CTR/CVR by segment, but to prove causality between style diversity and uplift, use stratified randomized experiments: assign exploration quotas per cohort/time slot, hold product, audience, and placement constant, vary only style. Use Thompson sampling or contextual bandits with a diversity regularizer: reward = business metric + λ*diversity_gain – penalties for brand/accessibility violations. Diversity_gain can be the increase in minimal distance to existing cluster centroids or improvement in portfolio coverage.\nPrevent collapse: (1) enforce a diversity budget at the planning level (e.g., 20–30% impressions reserved for exploratory styles); (2) set similarity ceilings (no more than N assets within a cosine ≤ 0.9 to any centroid per week); (3) rotate exploration across channels and segments; (4) age-off stale centroids to avoid anchoring to past trends. Human review gates: quarterly ‘style council’ to retire overused motifs; creative directors set ‘forbidden similarity’ zones; localization can veto exploration that risks cultural misfit.\nCausality: besides randomized tests, deploy difference-in-differences across markets that adopt the framework at staggered times; instrument the pipeline to log decisions (policy, λ values, arm chosen, embeddings). Run causal forests to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects (how diversity impacts subsegments). Guard against confounders with propensity scoring and pre-trend checks.\nOperationally, dashboards show mixture weights (explore vs exploit), style coverage heatmaps over time, KPI lift by distance bins, and alert when collapse is detected (e.g., Herfindahl–Hirschman Index over style centroids breaches threshold).",

Drift tests quarterly; adversarial suite.\n• Online: KPIs — complaint rate per 10k assets (<0.5), appeal overturns (<10%), exploration novelty index (median distance to nearest centroid increases ≥10% QoQ).\nFailure modes & fixes\n• Over-blocking: open ‘explore zones’ with novelty guidance; commission licensed packs. • Under-blocking: tighten τ, expand registry, add human pre-clear for high-risk briefs. • Evasion: update pattern library via red-team.
