What system design, governance, datasets, and evaluation loops would you implement so that (a) designers retain creative control, (b) localization teams can inject cultural knowledge, and (c) legal/compliance can block risky outputs in real time?",
        "think": "Start by clarifying the objectives and hard constraints: scale (25 markets), accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA), cultural nuance, and IP safety. Success requires a modular pipeline with human-in-the-loop gates rather than a monolithic generator. Decompose into services: (1) brief ingestion, (2) concept exploration, (3) asset generation, (4) localization & accessibility adaptation, (5) compliance & IP scanning, (6) evaluation & sign-off, and (7) telemetry/learning loop. Each service must expose controls so designers can steer direction and localization teams can override defaults.\nFor models, use a multi-model approach: a text model for creative briefs and copy variants, an image model for visual ideation, and a layout engine for templating. Add controllability: style tokens, ControlNet/conditioning, and design-system constraints (brand color tokens, typographic scales, spacing rules). To preserve brand identity, embed a machine-readable brand system (JSON: palette with acceptable contrast pairs, type ramp with minimum sizes, logo placement constraints). Implement a constraint solver that rejects generations violating brand or WCAG thresholds.\nFor data, curate three corpora: (A) first-party brand assets with lineage metadata and approvals, (B) market-local reference libraries vetted by cultural experts (e.g., motifs, symbolism, taboo lists), and (C) a rights-cleared training reference set with explicit licenses. Tag all entries with structured metadata: culture, register, emotional tone, age-appropriateness, and risk notes. Maintain an immutable provenance ledger per output: prompt, seeds, models, asset sources, reviewers, approvals.\nGovernance: define RACI. Designers own creative direction; localization leads own cultural sign-off; legal owns IP and claims; accessibility specialists own WCAG review. Establish red-team playbooks (bias, stereotyping, political missteps) and escalation paths. Build a real-time policy engine where legal/compliance can toggle blocklists (for imagery, symbols, phrases) per market.\nEvaluation: create automated checks before human review: (1) brand compliance score via perceptual similarity to reference styleboards; (2) WCAG color contrast checks, text legibility metrics, motion/flash thresholds; (3) cultural risk heuristics (symbol classifiers + market taboo lexicons); (4) IP safety via perceptual hashing and similarity search against known protected marks/style sets; (5) hallucination/claim detector for copy. Only assets passing thresholds move to human gates.\nHuman-in-the-loop: designers receive a controllable panel (sliders: novelty vs fidelity, cultural warmth, formality). Localization teams can swap motifs from their vetted libraries. Legal sees side-by-side similarity diffs, license provenance, and can hard-block variants. Close the loop with telemetry: track reasons for rejections, user edits, and post-campaign performance; feed back into prompt templates, risk thresholds, and market-specific guardrails.",

        "think": "Frame the problem as balancing exploitation (high-performing styles) with exploration (new looks) under brand and accessibility constraints. Need measurable style representation and an online learning strategy. Represent style as embeddings: compute a ‘style fingerprint’ for each asset using a multimodal model (e.g., CLIP-like) combining color histograms, composition descriptors, typography encodings, and motif tags. Maintain a style bank (centroids) by channel/market. Define diversity metrics at batch and portfolio levels: coverage (how much of style space we occupy), dispersion (variance), and novelty (distance from historical clusters). Also define similarity caps within campaigns to avoid duplicates.\nFor KPIs, track CTR/CVR by segment, but to prove causality between style diversity and uplift, use stratified randomized experiments: assign exploration quotas per cohort/time slot, hold product, audience, and placement constant, vary only style. Use Thompson sampling or contextual bandits with a diversity regularizer: reward = business metric + λ*diversity_gain – penalties for brand/accessibility violations. Diversity_gain can be the increase in minimal distance to existing cluster centroids or improvement in portfolio coverage.\nPrevent collapse: (1) enforce a diversity budget at the planning level (e.g., 20–30% impressions reserved for exploratory styles); (2) set similarity ceilings (no more than N assets within a cosine ≤ 0.9 to any centroid per week); (3) rotate exploration across channels and segments; (4) age-off stale centroids to avoid anchoring to past trends. Human review gates: quarterly ‘style council’ to retire overused motifs; creative directors set ‘forbidden similarity’ zones; localization can veto exploration that risks cultural misfit.\nCausality: besides randomized tests, deploy difference-in-differences across markets that adopt the framework at staggered times; instrument the pipeline to log decisions (policy, λ values, arm chosen, embeddings). Run causal forests to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects (how diversity impacts subsegments). Guard against confounders with propensity scoring and pre-trend checks.\nOperationally, dashboards show mixture weights (explore vs exploit), style coverage heatmaps over time, KPI lift by distance bins, and alert when collapse is detected (e.g., Herfindahl–Hirschman Index over style centroids breaches threshold).",

During diffusion, apply penalty if cosine(s_output, centroid_protected) > τ, or reject above τ_max; encourage movement toward brand/PD centroids.\n4) Similarity Service: Multimodal encoder produces embeddings; k-NN over protected artist neighborhoods; returns proximity score + exemplars for reviewer context.\n5) License Enforcer: Checks if prompt references a Licensed Pack; validates seat/title/market; injects watermark + C2PA terms.\n6) Human Review & Appeals: Borderline queue with side-by-side neighbors; 5-day SLA; decisions recorded; thresholds updated if overturn rate >15%.\n7) Transparency API: Creator lookup of registry status; opt-out portal; publish quarterly metrics (blocks, appeals, complaints).\nEvaluation & thresholds\n• Offline: ROC for protected-style detection; target FNR <3%, FPR <8%. Drift tests quarterly; adversarial suite.\n• Online: KPIs — complaint rate per 10k assets (<0.5), appeal overturns (<10%), exploration novelty index (median distance to nearest centroid increases ≥10% QoQ).\nFailure modes & fixes\n• Over-blocking: open ‘explore zones’ with novelty guidance; commission licensed packs. • Under-blocking: tighten τ, expand registry, add human pre-clear for high-risk briefs. • Evasion: update pattern library via red-team. Outcome: a firewall that respects artists while preserving space for original brand-aligned creativity.",

        "question": "Propose a multi-objective optimization framework that personalizes creative at inference (image + headline + layout) while guaranteeing (1) accessibility, (2) brand consistency, and (3) style diversity to avoid homogenization. Detail the algorithm (policy + constraints), serving architecture, online experimentation, and the proof plan that diversity causally lifts business KPIs without harming accessibility.",
        "think": "We must balance personalization for performance with three hard constraints: WCAG AA, brand rules, and portfolio diversity. Model the problem as constrained contextual bandits or constrained RL with safety shields. Context = user/device/channel/locale; actions = creative bundles (image, headline, layout) from a generator constrained by brand tokens and accessibility pre-checks; reward = CTR/CVR; constraints = accessibility pass, brand compliance, and diversity term ensuring style dispersion. Algorithm: use a Lagrangian or primal-dual approach—maximize expected reward plus λ_div * diversity_gain subject to hard constraints enforced by a safety layer. Diversity metric computed using style embeddings (CLIP-like + typography + composition). Serving: feature store feeds context; policy server selects bundle; safety layer executes preflight: contrast, text size, motion, logo placement; only feasible arms allowed. Bands of exploration governed by Thompson sampling with diversity regularizer; similarity ceilings per cluster/time window to prevent collapse. Online experimentation via interleaved testing: hold product/audience constant, randomize policy parameters (λ_div, explore %) across cohorts; collect accessibility pass rates, brand scores, and KPIs. Proof of causality: stratified RCTs + staggered rollout DiD; instrument all decisions; use causal forests for heterogeneity. Failure modes: constraint infeasibility (few arms pass), drift in embeddings, gaming of diversity metric. Mitigations: dynamic candidate generation, centroid refresh, human ‘style council’ to retire overused motifs. Provide dashboards: HHI_style, coverage, accessibility pass %, regret curves, and policy audit logs.",
        "output": "Algorithm\n• Candidate generation: conditioned generator proposes K bundles per request under brand tokens + layout templates. \n• Safety shield: filter bundles failing WCAG or brand rules. If none remain, trigger repair (color remap, font upsize) else fall back to default template.\n• Policy: contextual Thompson sampling with objective R(a)=w1*CTR+w2*CVR+λ_div*ΔCoverage(a). Feasibility enforced by shield; similarity ceiling caps impressions per style cluster per window. Adaptive λ_div↑ when HHI_style rises; ↓ when dispersion < floor.\n• Diversity metrics: style fingerprint = visual embedding ⊕ color histogram ⊕ layout/typography features. Portfolio coverage = clusters hit; dispersion = mean pairwise distance; novelty = min distance to historical centroids.\nServing architecture\n• Feature store (real-time context) → Policy server → Safety shield → Renderer (applies design tokens) → Telemetry (KPIs + accessibility + brand scores). C2PA provenance stamped per impression.\nExperimentation & proof\n• Stratified RCTs within product×audience×placement cells: vary λ_div and explore %. Primary endpoints: CTR/CVR; non-inferiority for accessibility (AA pass ≥98%) and brand compliance (≥0.85). \n• Staggered DiD across markets; validate pre-trends. Instrumentation logs (policy, λ_div, chosen bundle, embeddings, shield decisions). Causal forests to detect segments where diversity lifts KPIs.\nRisk management\n• Infeasible sets: widen candidate K; auto-repair; escalate to human templates. • Embedding drift: quarterly recalibration; red-team test set. • Metric gaming: hide metric from generator; evaluate on holdout fingerprints. Outcome: personalized creatives that remain accessible, brand-true, and measurably diverse while delivering KPI gains.",
