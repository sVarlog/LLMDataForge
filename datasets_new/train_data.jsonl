It should apply different elasticity curves per segment to avoid excessive increases for high-value customers.

This filtering must be dynamic, updating in near real-time as licensing agreements change. The personalization layer can then leverage collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and contextual signals to recommend only compliant titles. To reduce perceived content scarcity, the AI can suggest similar licensed titles when restricted content is excluded, preserving user engagement.

Natural language processing can extract relevant metrics from unstructured sustainability disclosures, while anomaly detection flags inconsistencies between reported data and observed outcomes. A standardized scoring framework, such as GRI or SASB, should be embedded into the model’s evaluation criteria. To maintain scalability, the system can prioritize deeper assessments for high-risk vendors based on industry, geography, and historical compliance. Blockchain-based data provenance could further enhance transparency and traceability of reported metrics.
